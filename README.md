# Emerald Tier

## Overview
This is Renewable Tools. May not be of interest to anyone when outside of the modpack it's designed for, but:
Adds Copper, Emerald, and Amethyst tools & armor.
Emerald tools are identical to iron, but have the durability of netherrite (in my upcoming modpack, villages don't spawn, so the only way to get emerald would be to mine it, or cure zombie villagers and trade for it)
Amethyst tools have the mining tiey and enchantability of stone, the durability of iron, and the efficiency of gold. (The idea is that amethyst tools, being highly renewable, would be good for large amounts of menial work i.e. teraforming, clearing a bunch of dirt/stone, hoeing a ton of dirt, etc. Built for doing a lot of basic things quickly, keeping in mind the infinite nature of amethyst)
Copper tools serve as a stepping stone between stone and iron, with the durability and enchantability of stone, but the mining tier and efficiency of iron. (a lot more copper than iron, especially on the overworld, so you're more likely to find enough copper for tools/armor than you are iron. Balanced around copper ore only dropping 1 ore per block.)

This mod is designed in the style of Minecraft pre-1.8 beta - and not just that, but is also designed for an upcoming modpack of mine. Please keep this in mind when using this mod.
