# Renewable Tools

## Overview
Adds tools, weapons, and armor for the renewable minerals of Minecraft; Emerald, Amethyst, and Copper. They're balanced to fill some small gaps between each tier of vanilla Minecraft, while being unique enough to stand out.

This mod is designed and balanced in the style of Minecraft pre-1.8 beta. Please keep this in mind when using this mod. Textures are not in line with the modern Minecraft textures. 

This mod is intended for use with my upcoming nostalgia themed modpack.

## Emerald
---
In my upcoming modpack, villages don't spawn, so the only ways to get emerald are mining it or curing zombie villagers and trading for it. The stats reflect this rarity & eventual renewability.
| Stat           | Value      |
|----------------|------------|
| Harvest tier   | Iron       |
| Speed          | Iron       |
| Enchantability | Iron       |
| Damage         | Iron       |
| Durability     | Netherrite |
| Defense        | Iron       |
| Toughness      | 1          |

## Amethyst
---
Because amethyst is highly renewable yet somewhat uncommon, the tools have been balanced around mid game disposability & efficiency, making them an upgrade over stone and leather. 
| Stat           | Value |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Harvest tier   | Stone |
| Speed          | Gold  |
| Enchantability | Gold  |
| Damage         | Stone |
| Durability     | Iron  |
| Defense        | Just below Iron  |
| Toughness      | 0     |

---
## Copper
---
Because copper is much more common than iron, especially on the surface, you're more likely to find enough copper for tools/armor than you are iron early on. As such, copper is a mix of stone and iron, serving as a good early game disposable set.
| Stat           | Value     |
| -------------- | --------- |
| Harvest tier   | Iron      |
| Speed          | Iron      |
| Enchantability | Stone     |
| Damage         | Stone     |
| Durability     | Stone     |
| Defense        | Chainmail |
| Toughness      | 0         |
